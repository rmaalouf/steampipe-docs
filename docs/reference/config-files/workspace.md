## workspace 

A Steampipe `workspace` is a "profile" that allows you to define a unified environment 
that the Steampipe client can interact with.  Each workspace is composed of:
- a single steampipe database instance
- a single mod directory (which may also contain dependency mods)
- context-specific settings and options  (snapshot location, search path, query options, etc)

Steampipe workspaces allow you to define multiple named configurations and easily switch between them using the `--workspace` argument or `STEAMPIPE_WORKSPACE` 
environment variable.

### Supported options  

| Argument            |    Default  | Description
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------
| `base`              | none                                          | A reference to a named workspace resource that this workspace should source its definition from. Any argument can be overridden after sourcing via base
| `cloud_host`        | `cloud.steampipe.io`                          | Set the Steampipe Cloud host, for connecting to Steampipe Cloud workspace
| `cloud_token`       | The token obtained by `steampipe login`       | Set the Steampipe Cloud authentication token for connecting to Steampipe Cloud workspace
| `snapshot_location` | The Steampipe Cloud user's personal workspace | Set the Steampipe CLoud workspace or filesystem path for reading and writing snapshots
| `mod_location`      | The current working directory                 | Set the workspace working directory
| `workspace_database`| `local`                                       | Workspace database. This can be local or a remote Steampipe Cloud database
| `search_path`       | `public`, then alphabetical                   | A comma-separated list of connections to use as a custom search path for the control run.
| `search_path_prefix`| none                                          | A comma-separated list of connections to use as a prefix to the current search path for the control run.
| `watch`             | `true`                                        | Watch .sql and .sp files in the current workspace (works only in interactive mode)        
| `max_parallel`      | 5                                             | Set the maximum number of parallel executions. When running steampipe check, Steampipe will attempt to run up to this many controls in parallel 
| `query_timeout`     | no limit                                      | The maximum time (in seconds) a query is allowed to run before it times out
| `option`            | none                                          | An option block to set command-specific options for this workspace.   Only `query` and `check` options are supported



Note that the HCL argument names are the same as the equivalent CLI argument names,
except using underscore in place of dash:
